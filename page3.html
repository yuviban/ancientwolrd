        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Introduction</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>The architecture of the Byzantine Empire (4th – 15th century CE) continued its early Roman  traditions but architects also added new structures to their already  formidable repertoire, notably improved fortification walls and domed  churches. There was, as well, a much greater concern for the interiors  of buildings rather than their exteriors. Christianity  influenced developments such as the conversion of the secular basilica  into a magnificent church with an impressive domed ceiling. Byzantine  buildings,&nbsp;in general, continued to employ the Classical orders but  became more eclectic and irregular, perhaps originally because old pagan  buildings were used as quarries to provide eclectic stone pieces for  new structures. This emphasis on function over form is a particular  aspect of Byzantine architecture, which blended influences from the Near East with the rich Roman and Greek  architectural heritage. Byzantine architecture would go on to influence  Orthodox Christian architecture and so is still seen today in churches  worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Roman Architecture</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>As Byzantium was the eastern half of the Roman Empire  in its early period, it is not surprising that the Roman traditions  continued in architecture as well as other facets of culture. Byzantine  urban areas were characterised by strong evidence of town planning,  large open spaces for commercial and public use, wide regular streets –  most of which were paved and the important ones were&nbsp;given porticoes –  and the use of public monuments such as statues of important figures and  monumental arches and city gates. The staple public services provided by a hippodrome, amphitheatre, and public baths were all still present, but some Roman-era buildings fell out of use, notably the gymnasium and stadium for athletics and, eventually, too, the theatre  as the bawdy pantomimes performed there met with the disapproval of the  church. As these buildings, and especially the pagan temples, fell into  disuse, their materials were reused, giving rise to new structures with  an eclectic mix of columns and capitals within the same structure,  which eventually became a defining feature of Byzantine buildings, and  the strict uniformity of classical buildings was abandoned.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Roman villas with private inner courtyards continued to be the  reserve of the wealthy while the poorer members of society lived in  basic multistorey buildings (<em>insulae</em>) where the ground floors  were often used as shops and taverns. Most of the population, though,  benefitted from access to running water, fountains, and drainage  systems, thanks to a well-planned system of pipes, aqueducts, and cisterns.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Architects and Materials</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>The construction of Byzantine buildings was supervised by two specialists: the rarer and more exalted <em>mechanikos</em> (or <em>mechanopoios</em>), a sort of mathematical engineer, and the <em>architekton</em>, a master builder. One or the other of these figures supervised a large group of craftspeople skilled in masonry, carpentry, wall-painting,  and making mosaics. As with Byzantine artists, architects were usually  anonymous, and very few were named after the 6th century CE.&nbsp;If the  construction project involved an imperial building or a church, then the  emperor or bishop was involved, in the case of private sponsors, they  too would have had a say in what the building looked like when finished.  Design drawings seem to have followed established conventions and been  sketchy, indicating a great deal of on-the-spot improvisation.</p>
        
        
        
        <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-12-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-112494" width="522" height="405" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-12-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art.jpg 750w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-12-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art-300x233.jpg 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-12-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art-50x39.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px"><figcaption><strong>Pegasus, a mythical winged divine stallion, was a prominent creature in the Greek mythology.

        <p>Like Roman architects, the Byzantines employed bricks for many  buildings, and it became the basic element of construction. A little  bigger than Roman bricks, those used in Constantinople,  for example, were square and measured up to 38 cm (15 inches) along  each side with a height of up to 6.5 cm (2.5 inches). Bricks were used  to create walls by laying two faces and pouring rubble and mortar  between them. The mortar was made from lime, sand, and crushed brick or  pebbles. Every so often a strengthening layer made wholly of bricks runs  through the entire wall. Unlike Roman walls, the Byzantine version did  not use a concrete (<em>pozzolana</em>) core, and so if the facing  became damaged, then, eventually, so too did the core. Another  difference is Byzantine builders used a much thicker layer of mortar  between bricks, probably as a cost-saving exercise as fewer bricks were  then needed. An unfortunate consequence of this is that as the mortar  dried, it warped, and so many Byzantine buildings suffer from distortion  or even partial collapse. Bricks were also used for domes, arches and  vaults, often then employing bricks of double the standard size.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>An alternative to brick was ashlar stone blocks, which were more popular in the eastern half of the Byzantine Empire.  Some buildings, particularly in the 6th century CE, combined the two  and had a lower part in brick and an upper part in stone cut blocks.  These materials and their use in Byzantine buildings remained virtually  unchanged right up to the 14th century CE. Marble, an expensive  material, was generally reserved for columns, capitals, cornices,  architraves, and decorative features such as door frames, window grills,  and paving.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Some building exteriors were plastered, but this was not common. Far  more attention was paid to building interiors where generally all the  walls were covered in plaster, stucco, thin marble plaques, paintings  and mosaics. Imperial buildings and important basilicas were given more  marble than anywhere else, with Proconnesian from the island of  Proconnesus in the Sea of Marmara being the most common. The prestige of  coloured marble continued from the western Roman tradition, and so it  was imported from such places as Egypt and Phrygia. Roofing in churches and houses was most often made from timber.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Churches</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>Starting with Constantine I (r. 306-337 CE) in the 4th century CE, churches were built everywhere to promote the new Christian religion and impose imperial authority on places far and wide, from the capital to Jerusalem. Another motivation to build churches and shrines (martyria) was to mark  places of significance to the Christian story and its saints, tombs of  saints and martyrs or their relics, and the site where a famed ascetic  may have dwelt. Thus, churches from Thessalonica  to Antioch became centres of pilgrimage in their own right. Many  smaller churches and modest chapels were built to serve smaller  communities. Other buildings closely associated with the church,  especially basilicas, were a baptistry, usually octagonal, and sometimes  a mausoleum for the founder of the church and their descendants, a  residence for a bishop, warehouses, administrative offices, perhaps a  shrine containing a tomb of a saint, and baths.</p>
        
        
        
        <div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-14-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art.png" alt="" class="wp-image-112495" width="497" height="327" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-14-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art.png 750w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-14-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art-300x198.png 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/121919-14-History-Byzantine-Byzantium-Architecture-Art-50x33.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px"><figcaption><strong>A diagram of one of the finest surviving Byzantine basilicas, the Church of Saint Irene in Istanbul (mid-6th century CE and remodelled in the 8th century CE) / Marsyas, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Millingen_H_Eirene_section.svg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Wikimedia Commons (opens in a new tab)">Wikimedia Commons</a></strong></figcaption></figure></div>
        
        
        
        <p>While brick, stone, or a mixture of both to create decorative patterns were the materials most often used for Byzantine churches, many were simply converted pagan temples or other secular buildings. A fine example is the Rotunda church of Thessalonica, probably originally meant as a mausoleum for Emperor Galerius and built during his reign of 305-311 CE but converted into a church in the 4th-6th century CE. Many more buildings liberally reused the high-quality stone blocks and column drums of Roman-era structures. Ancient capitals were also reused, although the Byzantines added more intricate and deeper carved decoration to their own Corinthian capitals, and they often added an impost (from the 4th century CE onwards) above the capital itself. This was a plain stone which gave the larger base needed to support heavy arches. Imposts are typically trapezoid in form and have a monogram or cross carved on them.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Most early churches followed the Roman basilica design, a building used for public gatherings, especially law  courts and markets. The basilica’s long hall and timber roof were  supported by columns and piers on all sides. The columns created a  central nave flanked on all sides by an aisle. A gallery ran around the  first floor, and later there was an apse at one or both ends.&nbsp;From the  5th century CE, the basilica church was common throughout the Byzantine  Empire. By the 6th century CE, the standard timber roof had given way to  a dome-vaulted one in larger basilicas. There developed many variations  in basilica design – they could have three, four, or five aisles, some  have much darker interiors such as those in Armenia while others in Syria  are much more monumental and use massive stone blocks. Several hundred  basilicas were built across the empire, with one of the largest being at  Lechaion near Corinth. There the basilica of Saint Leonidas  was 110 metres (360 ft) long and 30 metres (99 ft) wide. One of the  finest surviving basilicas is the Church of Saint Irene in Istanbul  (mid-6th century CE and remodelled in the 8th century CE).</p>
        
        
        
        <p>By the 9th century CE churches were still being built in numbers but  on a smaller scale as urban populations diminished and the large  basilica was no longer needed. Now a church only needed to accommodate  around 100 worshippers. There was no official church blueprint imposed  by the church hierarchy, but the cross-in-square plan became the most  common with a dome built over four supporting arches using pendentives –  curved triangular forms to bridge the gap between adjoining arches and  convert a square base into a circular one. The square base of the  building then branched into bays which might themselves have a half or  full dome ceiling. Another common feature is a central apse with two  side-apses at the eastern end of the church.</p>

        <p>Over time, the central dome was raised ever higher on a polygonal drum, which in some churches is so high it has the appearance of a tower. A fine example of this style, and also of patterned brickwork, is the early 14th-century CE Church of the Apostles in Thessalonica. The dome, then, became a suitably impressive representation of heaven and was decorated as such, with a representation of Jesus Christ very often being painted there. In addition, the structural necessity of the four arches supporting the dome created a floor plan in the shape of a cross, another powerful symbol of the building’s purpose. This type of church was built across the Byzantine Empire, and Greece, in particular, still has many fine examples in Athens, Thessalonica, Mistra, and many of the islands.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Hagia Sophia</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>The largest, most important and still most famous Byzantine church,  or indeed any building, is the Hagia Sophia of Constantinople, dedicated  to the holy wisdom (<em>hagia sophia</em>) of God. It was built in 532-537 CE during the reign of Justinian I  (r. 527-565 CE) on the site of two more modest versions dating back to  the 4th century CE. The building is unique and was never matched in  either size or design by any subsequent Byzantine building (although it  did become a model for Ottoman mosques from the 16th century CE). Its  basic rectangular shape measures 74.6 x 69.7 metres (245 x 229 ft). Its  huge domed ceiling is 55 metres above the floor and rests on four  massive arches with four supporting pendentives. This was a spectacular  achievement, and Justinian boasted he had managed to outdo Solomon,  but it was all rather too good to be true, and the dome collapsed in  558 CE, its cracks catastrophically worsened by two earthquakes. A  replacement – a structurally stronger ribbed and steeper dome measuring  31.8 metres in diameter – was made which still survives today (despite  partial collapses in 989 and 1346 CE). The Hagia Sophia was the biggest  church in the world until the 16th century CE and one of the most  decorated with many of its glittering mosaics and wall paintings still  wowing visitors today.</p>

        <p>Places specifically dedicated to monastic communities appeared from  the 4th century CE. They typically formed small villages enclosed by a  high perimeter wall and including a free-standing church, refectory for  communal eating, baths, library, workshops, accommodation and sometimes  an inn for pilgrims. Monasteries could also be built in cities; Constantinople boasted 30 by the mid-6th century CE. Many Byzantine monasteries are still in use today, Mount Athos  (from the 9th century CE onwards) in Greece being one spectacular  location. Another excellent example is the well-preserved  mid-6th-century CE monastery of Saint Catherine, Mount Sinai, Egypt.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Bridges</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>Bridges were, as in earlier Roman times, important connectors in the Byzantine road and aqueduct system. A fine 6th-century CE example survives over the Sangarius (Sakarya) River in Turkey.  Constructed using large ashlar blocks, it stretches 428 metres (469  yards) and includes seven arches, each spanning around 23 metres (75  ft). The bridge once had a monumental gateway measuring 10 metres (33  ft) in height. An example of a single arch bridge may be seen near  Elazig, eastern Turkey.

        <p>The 4th century CE saw an increased threat from those cultures which neighboured both halves of the Roman Empire. Emperor Constantine  I began the process of better defending Constantinople by extending the  sea walls and building a new land wall across the peninsula on which  the capital stood. To increase the space within the city’s  fortifications, Theodosius II (r. 408-450 CE) built a second, larger  wall which became known as the Theodosian Walls.  A line of three walls with a protective ditch, the third wall was the  most massive being 5 metres thick, 12 metres high, and having 96  projecting towers. Each tower was placed around 70 metres distant from  another and reached a height of 20 metres.&nbsp;Built using bricks and  limestone, these walls would protect the greatest city of the Middle  Ages for over 800 years.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>The 6th century CE saw a massive building project of forts, walls,  and towers to better protect the more vulnerable sections of the  empire’s borders (which were just about everywhere from Mesopotamia to Balkans). Many Roman fortifications were regularly maintained such as those at Nicaea in northwest Anatolia  where the city’s walls were repaired in the 8th, 9th, and 13th century  CE. A few of these fortifications remain in good condition still today,  for example, at Zenobia (Halabiye) on the Euphrates.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Housing</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>Very few remains survive of Byzantine domestic architecture. Most 
        domestic housings were made from wood and mud bricks, but stone was used
        for the wealthier homeowner. Villas continued along Roman lines until 
        the 6th century CE, and thereafter the trend is towards smaller homes, 
        even if some irregular large houses did continue to be built, sometimes 
        with second-floor balconies. Most homes would not have had running 
        water, but better houses in cities usually had their own toilets 
        emptying into a cesspit. It was a particular Byzantine habit to spruce 
        up more drab buildings with fine silks and wall hangings. Paintings, 
        especially icons, were another source of decoration.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>Cites continued to be supplied with water via aqueducts (Roman ones 
        were still used and regularly repaired) and cisterns. One of the most 
        impressive Byzantine architectural achievements which can still be seen 
        today are the underground cisterns of Istanbul with their hundreds of 
        columns supporting arched and domed ceilings. The best examples are the 
        5th- and 6th-century CE Jere-batan Serai and Bin-bir-derek cisterns.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">Legacy</h2>
        
        
        
        <p>The influence of Byzantine architecture was spread via conquest  and imitation. Constantinople was, for centuries, the capital of  Christianity, and Christian rulers everywhere sought to capture the  prestige of its glorious buildings in their own cities. Thus, the  11th-century CE Basilica of Saint Mark in Venice, for example, copied a  Byzantine model which was by then already 500 years old. Russian princes  were similarly impressed and built orthodox churches which were  Byzantine in style. Even those places with a strong architectural  tradition of their own, such as Armenia and Georgia, absorbed elements  of Byzantine architecture. Then there were the clergy themselves who  copied the established Byzantine church and monastery layouts and  ensured their survival even when the Byzantine Empire had long since  collapsed. Hundreds of churches were destroyed when the Empire was  conquered, many were converted into mosques, too, but enough survive to  reveal the ambition of Byzantine architects and their sponsors. Further,  in places where Christianity has returned, restorations have been  carried out, and so many Byzantine buildings are still very much in use  today from Corfu to Sinai.</p>
