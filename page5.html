<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Balance and harmony with natural surroundings and an aesthetic of elegant understatement were always essential considerations for the ancient Japanese architect.</strong></p>
<hr>


<hr>
<p>The architecture of the 80,000 Shinto shrines in Japan varies depending on geographical location, the deity worshipped, and the date of foundation. The earlier Shinto shrines tend to be simpler and less decorative affairs than those which came after the introduction of Buddhism and Chinese architectural styles in Japan from the 8th century CE onwards. Later shrines are brightly painted and have more sculptural elements, but there are many common features to all Shinto shrine complexes from the distinctive<em> torii </em>gateways to the gently sloping gabled roofs of even the smallest structures. In addition, balance and harmony with natural surroundings and an aesthetic of elegant understatement were always essential considerations for the ancient Japanese architect charged with creating a home on earth for the spirit of one or more of the Shinto gods.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">General Features</h1>
<p>The buildings of a Shinto shrine are typically built using wood, especially the Hinoki Cypress (<em>Chamaecyparis </em><em>obtusa</em>), which may be left plain or painted. Nails and glue are rare, with buildings constructed using the post and lintel technique with cut and fitted joints. Wooden columns are either set directly into the ground or, in the majority of cases, sit on a stone base. The wall panels between columns and posts are made of wood panelling, clay or plaster spread over a thin bamboo framework. In an attempt to protect shrines from fire, a few were built during the Edo Period (1603-1868 CE) using thick mud brick walls which were then plastered. Some shrine buildings are highly decorative while others can be very austere.</p>
<p>Early shrines, which first appeared from around the 6th century BCE, often copied the architecture of thatched rice storehouses, but from the Nara period in the 8th century BCE onwards, temple design was influenced by Chinese, and especially Buddhist, architecture – upturned gables, and a prodigious use of bright red paint and decorative elements. Roofs are always gabled, commonly with a hip and gable design (<em>irimoya</em><em>–</em><em>zukuri</em>) or asymmetrical gable (<em>nagare</em><em>–</em><em>zukuri</em>). Many have a false dormer (<em>chidorihafu</em>) which looks like a letter A rising upwards from the roof above the entrance. Verandas are a common feature as the roof extends beyond the building itself and the eaves are supported by brackets, ornate or plain.</p>
<p>Some shrines have V-shaped projections (<em>chigi</em>) from the ridge pole of the roof which they supported underneath in original wooden buildings but today are usually only decorative. The cut of the ends of these <em>chigi</em> indicates the sex of the deity of the shrine: vertical cut for male and horizontal for female. Another decorative element is the <em>katsuogi</em>, cylinders placed at a right angle along the roof ridge which once kept the thatch in place in early shrines.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-24-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-69850" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-24-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="327" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-24-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x225.jpg 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-24-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-50x38.jpg 50w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-24-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-285x214.jpg 285w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-24-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Naiku shrine at the Ise Grand Shrine, sacred to the Shinto goddess Amaterasu. The shrine was first built in 4 BCE and since the 7th century CE it has been rebuilt exactly every 20 years. Mie Prefecture, Japan. / Photo by Malinche, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/malinche/2729549414/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a>, Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p>Roofs have a wide variety of protection including ceramic tiles, sheet copper, copper shale, cedar shale, or cypress bark. Thatched roofs use straw or <em>kaya</em> grass (Miscanthus). Outer surfaces are often decorated with representations of flowers, animals, mythical creatures, and allegorical scenes. The interior walls of buildings and sliding paper partitions may be decorated with similar scenes.</p>
<p>Decorative features added to many temple sites include streamers, lanterns, and animal statues. Thick twists of rope (<em>shimenawa</em>) are hung in various places and from them dangle white, zig-zag paper or cloth streamers (<em>shide</em>) which are considered an assistance for the shrine’s <em><a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Kami/">kami</a></em>&nbsp;or spirit to descend to earth. Another form of ritual offering are lanterns which are sometimes large, ornate and made of stone, wood, or bronze, but there are also simpler versions in paper. Finally, statues of lions (misleadingly known as <em>komainu</em> or ‘Korean dogs’), deer, and foxes dotted around the site act as guardian figures.</p>
<p>Many shrines are regularly rebuilt and/or refurbished, on average every 20 years or so, in a process known as <em>shikinen</em> <em>sengu</em> so that they maintain a pristine appearance, preserve the energy force of the shrine, and are free of the decay and impurity, which the Shinto religion demands. As it takes many years to build a shrine it is a common sight to see two buildings side by side as the new version is being constructed.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Building Types</h1>
<p>The typical Shinto shrine complex or <em>jinja</em> includes some or all of the following common architectural features, depending on its size and importance:</p>
<h3><strong>Torii</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-25-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-69851" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-25-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="443" height="295" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-25-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-25-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-50x33.jpg 50w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-25-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Fushimi Inari Shrine near Kyoto (Heiankyo) is the largest and most important shrine dedicated to Inari, the Shinto god of rice and prosperity. It is famous for the large number of red gates (torii) at the site. The shrine was founded in 711 CE by the Hata clan and moved from its original location on Mt. Inari to its present location near Kyoto in the 9th century CE. / Photo by James Blake Wiener, Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p><em>Torii</em> are sacred gateways which symbolically separate the sacred space of the shrine from the external world. The simplest and most common are merely two upright posts with two longer crossbars (<em>kasagi</em> and <em>nuki</em>), known as the <em>myojin</em> <em>torii</em>, but there are many variations such as the ornate <em>ryobu</em><em> torii,</em> which usually stand in water, and <em>miwa</em> <em>torii,</em> which has a triple gate. <em>Torii </em>are usually made of wood but they can also be of stone, steel, copper, or concrete. Many <em>torii</em> are painted red, and they are often festooned with <em>gohei</em>, twin paper, cloth or metal strips each ripped in four places and symbolising the <em>kami</em>‘s presence.</p>
<h3><strong>Romon</strong></h3>
<p>A <em>romon</em> is a large gate building which marks the entrance to the main shrine. From the outside, it seems to have two storeys, especially when there is a small balcony running around the building, but actually, it has only one. The central entrance is flanked by covered bays which contain guardian figure statues known as <em>zuijin</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>Honden</strong></h3>
<p>The <em>honden</em> or shrine’s main hall contains an image or manifestation of the particular <em>kami </em>or spirit worshipped there, the <em>goshinta</em><em>i</em>. The interior is divided into two parts: the <em>naijin</em> or inner sanctuary and the <em>gejin</em> or outer sanctuary. The <em>naijin</em> contains the <em>goshintai</em> and is almost always closed to anyone except the shrine’s chief priest and even he may not have actually seen the <em>goshintai</em>. Sometimes the doors of the <em>naijin</em> may be opened on special occasions such as shrine anniversaries. Around the <em>honden</em> is a fence, the <em>tamagaki</em>, which limits the sacred area of typically white gravel or sand and it may even limit the view of the <em>honden</em> from outside.</p>
<h3><strong>Haiden</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-26-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-69852" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-26-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="299" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-26-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x207.jpg 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-26-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-50x35.jpg 50w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-26-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A 19th century CE drawing of the Shinto shrine complex at Izumo-taisha, Japan. / <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Izumotaisha_17feb1875.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a></strong></p>
<p>The <em>haiden</em> or oratory hall is for ceremonies and worship&nbsp;and is usually the most impressive building at the shrine. It may stand alone or be connected to the <em>honden</em> by a short covered corridor.</p>
<h3><strong>Heiden</strong></h3>
<p>The <em>heiden</em>, located between the <em>honden</em> and the <em>haiden</em>, is a building (or simply part of a covered corridor) used for prayers and making offerings (<em>heihaku</em>). The term <em>shaden</em> refers to the <em>honden</em>, <em>haiden,</em> and <em>heiden,</em> all together.</p>
<h3><strong>Secondary Buildings</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-27-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-69853" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-27-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x201.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="291" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-27-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x201.jpg 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-27-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-50x33.jpg 50w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-27-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 434px) 100vw, 434px"></a></p>

<p>The <em>temizuya</em>, a stone water trough and font for ritual cleansing of a worshipper’s hands and mouth. The basin may take the form of a dragon, which is a water deity in Shinto, and stand beneath a small roof. The <em>kaguraden</em> is a pavilion for ritual dancing and music, the <em>shamusho</em> is the administration building, and the <em>shinsenden</em> is for preparing food for offerings. The <em>sando</em> or sacred path runs through the shrine grounds or <em>keidai</em> and joins the <em>torii</em> and <em>haiden</em>. The <em>kairo</em> is a covered and colonnaded walkway which extends around the inner sacred area of the shrine. Larger shrines may also have a large assembly hall and a place for displaying valuable and sacred artworks, the <em>homotsuden</em> or treasure hall.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;">Architectural Styles</h1>
<p>There are several distinct building styles in Shinto shrines.</p>
<h3><strong>Shinmei-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong></h3>
<p>This style of<em> honden</em> imitates the wooden rice storage buildings of Japan’s Yayoi Period (c. 300 BCE – c. 250 CE) which are known by their appearance on such artefacts as bronze mirrors. They are built on raised stilts, have round poles with panelling for walls, and a gable roof which creates a veranda on all four sides. One roof-supporting pole is left outside the building at either end. Steps lead to a single side entrance and there are no windows. The roof is thatch and has both <em>chigi</em> and <em>katsuogi</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>Taisha-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-28-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-69854" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-28-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x219.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="318" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-28-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x219.jpg 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-28-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-50x37.jpg 50w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-28-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The honden of the Shinto Izumo-taisha shrine, Shimane, Japan. Founded prior to the 7th century CE, the present building dates to 1744 CE. / Photo by Blue Lotus, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Izumo-taisha_121538651_f69f257ed0_o.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikimedia Commons</a></strong></p>
<p>Deriving from the house of the headman in ancient villages, this is the oldest architectural style and has a <em>honden</em> with a front stepped and roofed entrance set to the right side. The roof gable extends at the front and a veranda encircles the building. The door has horizontal panels with the top one being hinged and opening upwards.</p>
<h3><strong>Nagare-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong></h3>
<p>The most common style with the roof being asymmetrical and gently upward curving. The entrance is at the side on a wide veranda below the overhanging roof which extends out on the entrance side of the building and is supported by columns. The similar <em>ryonagare</em><em>–</em><em>zukuri</em> has the roof extending at the back too.</p>
<h3><strong>Irimoya-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong></h3>
<p>Any building with a hip-and-gable roof.</p>
<h3><strong>Gongen-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong><strong> (aka Yatsumune-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong><strong>)</strong></h3>
<p>In this style, the <em>honden</em> and <em>haiden</em> are joined under a single roof which has an intermediate space known as the <em>ainoma</em> or <em>ishinoma</em>. The <em>ainoma</em> has a roof with a ridge at right angles to the roof ridges of the two joined buildings creating an I shape when seen from above. The style is highly decorative with many carvings, lacquer work, and gold or copper additions, indicating its origins in Buddhist architecture.</p>
<h3><strong>Hachiman-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-29-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-69855" src="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-29-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="293" srcset="https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-29-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-29-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto-50x33.jpg 50w, https://brewminate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/090818-29-Architecture-Art-History-Japan-Shinto.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px"></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Stone votive lanterns at the Kasuga Taisha Shinto shrine, Nara, Japan. Founded in 768 CE (or 710 CE) during the Nara period. / Photo by James Blake Wiener, Creative Commons</strong></p>
<p>In this style, two buildings are placed side by side so that their roofs are almost touching. In between is a narrow connecting building acting as a covered corridor. Wooden parts are painted red, and the walls are covered in white plaster, while the roof is of Cypress bark.</p>
<h3><strong>Kasuga-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong></h3>
<p>Seen at smaller shrines, here the <em>honden</em> is a simple rectangular structure with a curved gabled roof decorated with <em>chigi</em> at each roof end and <em>katsuogi</em>. The entrance is via steps covered by a simple roof canopy. Wooden parts are painted red and black, while the walls are plastered white.</p>
<h3><strong>Sumiyoshi-</strong><strong>zukuri</strong></h3>
<p>Here the shrine is similar to but double the size of a <em>kasuga</em><em>–</em><em>zukuri</em> <em>honden</em>. The stepped front entrance has no roof covering and the gabled roof is not curved. Wooden parts are painted red, and the walls are plastered white.</p>
